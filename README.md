# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## User Stories:
- Users can create/delete accounts
- Users can create/delete their own recipes/meals (format should be uniform with RapidAPI) 
(Authentification needed to verify user access to the correct paths)
- Users can import a recipe from another website (see below)
- Users have access to food database to search for nutritional value of individual items
- Users can compile nutritional data for the recipes they chose (see below)
- Users can search for recipes based on an image they upload (accuracy depends on mobilenet)
- Users will have access to a grocery list component of all their ingredients (debating on including portions)from selected meals/recipes. 
- Users can also compile a nutrient list component of all the ingredients on selected meals/recipes.

## Beta Functionality (Not Tested)
- Users can save meals and recipes they find or have an HTML link to => (Rapid API to parse ingredients from recipe??)
- Users can upload a picture of a meal or something they ate and use image recognition AI to help classify (Mobilenet, may need to preprocess images)
- Ingredients from recipes can be mapped to items in the food database => (typesense + user input to save pairings).  If ingredient has exactly one match in the database it can be automatically added to user's meal - otherwise user can select from options.
Alternatively user will have to manually recreate their recipe by searching from food database.  



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
